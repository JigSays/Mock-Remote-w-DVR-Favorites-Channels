Grading Notes: Cannot dismiss the keyboard after entering channel name in the label in configuration view. <br>
The label must be between 1 ~ 4 letters. It doesn't allow 4 letters. <br>
The save button doesn't work as intended: Save new fav channel KOR and channel to 12 in configuration. Move to TV view. Click the KOR and the channel doesn't change.
